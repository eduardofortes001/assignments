# Introduction

This is the answer to a proposed challenge. I coded this in this weekend, that said, there is a plenty of room for improvements.


## Deployment

To deploy this project simply download the main.py script and execute locally.

Make sure you have Python 3 installed:
```bash
~$ python3 --version
```
The output should be something similar:
  ```bash
Python 3.8.10
```
You also make sure you have the  modules boto3 and tabulate installed: 
  ```bash
~$ pip list | grep boto3 && pip list | grep tabulate
```
Output expected (versions may vary) :
```bash
boto3                  1.18.31             
tabulate               0.8.9
```
If any requirements are not met, please check the appendix session
about how to install Python and the modules needed.

Download the file main.py on the [link](https://github.com/eduardofortes001/assignments) or clone the following Github repository:
```bash
~$ git clone https://github.com/eduardofortes001/assignments
```
Make main.py executable:
```bash
~$ chmod +x main.py
```
Execute it:
```bash
~$ ./main.py
```
